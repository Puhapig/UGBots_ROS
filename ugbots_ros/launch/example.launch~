#We are using roslaunch to run different robots of the same type(node)
#This is just an example and you'll probably need to build your own launch file later

<launch>
	#you select the namespace, by default the first robot is robot_0
	<group ns="robot_0">
		#pkg is the package file name obviously
		#not sure what name is for, but it can be anything
		#the type is what the robot node is called, this is initialised in the CMakeLists and your cpp file
		<node pkg="ugbots_ros" name="robotnode" type="R0"/>
	</group>
	
	#Now I'm selecting the second robot and using the same robot node, but without a conflict 
	<group ns="robot_1">
		<node pkg="ugbots_ros" name="robotnode" type="R0"/>
	</group>

	#If you don't know what happens when you try to run the same node, try now
	
</launch>
